### Prerequisites

Ruby: 2.7.0
Rails: 6.1.3

$ git clone https://github.com/oloomoses/referral-assignment.git
$ cd referral-assignment
~~~

```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Deploy to a live server

Deploying to a live server like Heroku is easy, make sure you have the necessary credentials setup on your local machine
Heroku uses Posgres as its default data base. So ensure that you install it and remove sqlite.

```bash
heroku create
heroku rename app-new-name
git push heroku $BRANCH_NAME:master 
```
if you are already in master branch no need to add $BRANCH_NAME, just use `git push heroku master`

```bash
heroku run rails db:migrate
heroku open
```

Enjoy your newly deployed rails API
